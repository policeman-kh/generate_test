## Investigation of auto generation unit tests with Java.

I investigated tools with Java to generate unit tests automatically. 

I found 4 tools like below
and I generated unit tests from 2 types of my codes with them.
- Simple class with static method. [NumberUtils](src/main/java/test/NumberUtils.java)
- Service class of Spring MVC having dependency injection.  [ZipCodeService](src/main/java/test/zipcode/ZipCodeService.java)

Please see the details ( summary / preparation / how to generate ) from the following readme documents.
